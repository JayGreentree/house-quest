# House Quest (Craft)

A sample site for the Astro Quick-Start Guide on [CraftQuest](https://craftquest.io).

Based on @nystudio107's awesome starter project. Simplified for learning purposes, and updated to Craft 4.

## Setting Up Local Dev

You'll need [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for your platform installed to run devMode in local development

Ensure no other local development environments are running that might have port conflicts, then:

* Start up the site by typing `make dev` in terminal in the project's root directory (the first build will be somewhat lengthy)
* Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to use the site; the `vite-dev-server` runs off of `http://localhost:3000`

Wait until you see the following to indicate that the PHP container is ready:

```
php_1         | Craft is installed.
php_1         | Applying changes from your project config files ... done
php_1         | [01-Dec-2020 18:38:46] NOTICE: fpm is running, pid 22
php_1         | [01-Dec-2020 18:38:46] NOTICE: ready to handle connections
```

...and the following to indicate that the Vite container is ready:
```
vite_1        |   vite v2.3.2 dev server running at:
vite_1        |
vite_1        |   > Local:    http://localhost:3000/
vite_1        |   > Network:  http://172.22.0.5:3000/
vite_1        |
vite_1        |   ready in 1573ms.
```

The CP login credentials are initially set as follows:

Login: `admin` \
Password: `password`

Obviously change these to whatever you like as needed.

Build the production assets by typing `make build` to build the critical CSS, fonts, and other production assets. They will appear in `cms/web/dist/` (just double-click on the `report-legacy.html` and `report-modern.html` files to view them).

**N.B.:** Without authorization & credentials (which are private), the `make pulldb` will not work (it just runs `scripts/docker_pull_db.sh`). It's provided here for instructional purposes.

## Makefile Project Commands

This project uses Docker to shrink-wrap the devops it needs to run around the project.

To make using it easier, we're using a Makefile and the built-in `make` utility to create local aliases. You can run the following from terminal in the project directory:

- `make dev` - starts up the local dev server listening on `http://localhost:8000/`
- `make build` - builds the static assets via the Vite buildchain
- `make clean` - removes the `cms/composer.lock` & the entire `cms/vendor/` directory as well as the `buildchain/package-lock.json` & the entire `buildchain/node_modules/` directory
- `make composer xxx` - runs the `composer` command passed in, e.g. `make composer install`
- `make craft xxx` - runs the `craft` [console command](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/console-commands.html) passed in, e.g. `make craft project-config/apply` in the php container
- `make npm xxx` - runs the `npm` command passed in, e.g. `make npm install`
- `make nuke` - restarts the project from scratch by running `make clean` (above), then shuts down the Docker containers, removes any mounted volumes (including the database), and then rebuilds the containers from scratch
- `make pulldb` - runs the `scripts/docker_pull_db.sh` script to pull a remote database into the database container; the `scripts/.env.sh` must be set up first
- `make restoredb xxx` - runs the `scripts/docker_restore_db.sh` script to restore a local database dump into the database container; the `scripts/.env.sh` must be set up first
- `make ssh` - opens up a Unix shell inside the PHP container for the project

### Vite buildchain

This project uses a [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) for the build system as per [Vite.js Next Generation Frontend Tooling + Craft CMS](https://nystudio107.com/blog/using-vite-js-next-generation-frontend-tooling-with-craft-cms), as opposed to the usual webpack buildchain.

Vite is _fast_ âš¡

### Default Plugins
* [Vite](https://nystudio107.com/plugins/vite) - for loading Vite-generated `manifest.json` resources in a modern way
